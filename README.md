## 🎯 Problem Statement

MSPs and IT teams face alert overload from monitoring tools, forcing technicians to manually triage each alert causing:
- ⏰ **45+ minute average resolution time** per incident
- 😰 **Alert fatigue** from 100+ daily alerts
- 💸 **$250K/year wasted** on manual triage (mid-size MSP)
- 🔥 **Missed critical incidents** buried in noise

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Current Production Architecture

Our system leverages AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS Bedrock to deliver intelligent, autonomous alert triage:

```
Alert → EB Load Balancer → FastAPI (4 workers) → AWS Bedrock (Nova Pro) →
Safety Validator → Execution Engine → Target Systems → ITSM Update
```

**Key Components:**
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Auto-scaling compute with 4 Gunicorn workers
- **AWS Bedrock**: Amazon Nova Pro for cost-effective AI reasoning
- **Context Engine**: Fuses alerts + history + SOPs for intelligent analysis
- **Safety Layer**: 8-point validation before any script execution
- **Audit Trail**: Complete CloudWatch logging for compliance

### 📊 Detailed Architecture & Roadmap

For comprehensive architecture documentation, including:
- 🔄 **Current production architecture** (EB + Bedrock)
- 🚀 **Proposed serverless architecture** (Lambda + Step Functions + Bedrock Agents)
- 🔒 **Security architecture** (IAM, PoLP, Confused Deputy prevention)
- 📈 **Scalability & performance benchmarks**
- 💰 **Cost optimization strategies**
- 🛡️ **Disaster recovery & multi-region setup**
- 📚 **Migration path** from current to proposed

**👉 See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed diagrams and technical specs**

### Future Vision: Enterprise-Grade Serverless

```
EventBridge → SQS → Lambda → Step Functions → Bedrock Agents →
Knowledge Bases (OpenSearch) → SSM Run Command → Multi-Region DR
```

**Planned Improvements:**
- ⚡ **36,000 alerts/hour** (360x current throughput)
- 🎯 **50% latency reduction** (P99: 18s → 9s)
- 💵 **12% cost reduction** with unlimited scaling
- 🔍 **X-Ray distributed tracing** for observability
- 🌍 **Multi-region active-passive DR** (RTO: 15 min)

- All backend code and data files

### Deploy Your Own Instance

1. **Install AWS EB CLI:**
   ```bash
   pip install awsebcli
   ```

2. **Initialize EB:**
   ```bash
   eb init -p python-3.11 alert-triage-ai --region us-east-1
   ```

3. **Create deployment package:**
   ```bash
   python create_deploy_zip.py
   ```

4. **Deploy via AWS Console:**
   - Go to AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console
   - Create new application: "alert-triage-ai"
   - Upload alert-triage-ai-v3.zip
   - Configure environment variables (AWS credentials)
   - Deploy!

5. **Access your application:**
   - Frontend + Backend: `http://your-env-name.elasticbeanstalk.com/`
   - API docs: `http://your-env-name.elasticbeanstalk.com/docs`
   - The frontend automatically uses the same domain for API calls

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# AWS Credentials (Required)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Optional
USE_CACHED_RESPONSES=false  # Set to true for demo reliability
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
```

### Knowledge Base (data/sop_kb.json)
Add new alert types by creating SOP entries:
```json
{
  "your_alert_type": {
    "title": "Description of alert type",
    "triggers": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "systems": ["Windows Server", "Linux"],
    "steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "..."],
    "safety_notes": ["Safety requirement 1", "..."]
  }
}
```

The agent automatically learns new capabilities!

---

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```powershell
# Check if port 8000 is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Verify virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python --version  # Should show 3.9+
```

### Frontend shows 404 errors
```powershell
# Backend must be running first
# Verify: http://localhost:8000/

# Check backend logs for errors
# Look for "Auto-loaded demo alert: INC0012345"
```

### AWS Bedrock errors
```powershell
# Verify AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check Bedrock model access
aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-east-1

# Enable cached responses for testing
# Edit .env: USE_CACHED_RESPONSES=true
```

### Analysis takes too long
- Normal: 5-8 seconds for Amazon Nova Pro reasoning
- Check internet connection
- Enable cached responses for instant demo
