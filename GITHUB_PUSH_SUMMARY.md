## ⚠️ MANUAL ACTIONS REQUIRED BEFORE PUSH

### CRITICAL - Must Do Now:

1. **Update README.md Placeholders** (5 locations):
   ```
   Line 342: [Your repo URL] → https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alert-triage-ai
   Line 343: [YouTube/Loom link] → Add after recording demo
   Line 344: [your-email@example.com] → Add your email
   Line 345: [Your LinkedIn profile] → Add LinkedIn URL
   Line 346: [Submission link] → Add SuperHack submission link
   Line 358: [your-repo-url] → Same as line 342
   ```

2. **Update SECURITY.md Contact**:
   ```
   Line 24: [your-email@example.com] → Add your email
   Line 131: [your-email@example.com] → Add your email
   ```

3. **Save Your Real API Key Separately**:
   ```
   Your Gemini API Key: AIzaSyAUeBl-5iyUTMR7htki7ikVz_Caho6M6RI
   
   ⚠️ SAVE THIS SOMEWHERE SAFE!
   After pushing to GitHub, you'll need to:
   1. Copy .env.example to .env
   2. Replace the placeholder with your real key
   ```

4. **Test Everything Locally**:
   ```powershell
   # Start the app
   .\START.ps1
   
   # Test API
   .\test_api.ps1
   
   # Verify everything works!
   ```

## 🎬 DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT

**When you're ready to record (2 minutes):**

```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"Hi! I'm Sahil from Team Integrator. This is our Agentic Alert Triage AI 
for SuperHack 2025. It uses Gemini Pro to automatically analyze and resolve 
IT alerts 89% faster than manual triage."

[0:15-0:30] Show Alert
"Here's a critical disk space alert on our production database server. 
95% full. Normally this would take 45 minutes to resolve manually."

[0:30-1:00] AI Analysis
"Watch as our AI agent gathers context from device history, our knowledge 
base, and analyzes with Gemini Pro. It identifies IIS logs as the root 
cause with 92% confidence and generates a safe PowerShell script with 
8 safety checks."

[1:00-1:30] Execution
"The technician reviews and approves. The script executes via our RMM 
integration in demo mode. 12.3 GB freed, disk down to 42%, ticket 
auto-closed. Total time: 4 minutes."

[1:30-2:00] Impact
"This same agent handles patch management and service monitoring too. 
Just add SOPs to the knowledge base - no code changes needed. For a 
500-device MSP, that's $250K in annual savings. GitHub link in description. 
Thank you!"
```
